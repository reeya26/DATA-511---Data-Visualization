# Analyzing the World Indicators Dataset

To understand any complex dataset, one can conduct exploratory visual analysis on it to identify the
underlying trends and patterns in the data. For this assignment, we will analyze the World Development
Indicators dataset which is published by The World Bank.

Over half of the refugees in 2018 were children under the age of 18. The refugee crisis isn’t just a
humanitarian issue, it is a highly politicized one which has citizens divided throughout the world. Over
the last few years, numerous elections have been conducted in developed countries, wherein certain
politicians promised to “curb” this issue. Thereby, making it clear to the masses that they do not support
giving asylum to the refugees as they believe this will rob their citizens of the resources that the country
has to offer.

Using the data and analyzing the various metrics provided in it, we can answer the following question, **“Is
the refugee crisis supported equitably by all countries?”** To answer this question, we will first Clean and
Manipulate the dataset using Tableau Prep, and Visualize it using Tableau Desktop.
